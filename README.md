# JavaScript Games

## Information
A collection of games made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Very minimal design/styling was applied.

## Games List:

### Rock, Paper, Scissors
A simple rock, paper, scissors game where the user can make a choice, and the computer makes a psuedorandom choice, and the winner is displayed.

### Memory Game
A memory tile-flipping game where the user tries to find all matching cards. Everytime two matching cards are found, they are removed from the grid. Alerts will display when users find two matching cards, or if they are not matching. A score counter tracks the number of pairs the user has matched. Finally, a message displays at the end to let the user know they have found all the cards!
